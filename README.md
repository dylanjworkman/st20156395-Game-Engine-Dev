# o3d_1-12_bull_3_player

An extension to the 2nd base project for CMU students studying Game Engine Development. 

This one combines Ogre3d (1.12) and Bullet (3.0), working with a Player object which can be 'driven' via the keyboard.  The control is intentionally rough encouraging students to improve on the forces used to control the player object.  Note: Bullet also provides a kinematic object (one whose velocity/orientation can be set more rigidly) specifically for players in some games.
